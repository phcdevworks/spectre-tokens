# COPILOT.md - Spectre Tokens Support

## Role Summary

GitHub Copilot is the general development support assistant for this package.
Copilot helps with targeted edits, refactors, TypeScript assistance, test
suggestions, API usage hints, and documentation synchronization.

Copilot does not own implementation direction, architecture, release
coordination, production stabilization ownership, repo-wide AI governance, or
automated maintenance workflows.

## Authority Boundaries

- Claude Code remains lead implementation owner (`CLAUDE.md`).
- Codex owns documentation, releases, production stabilization, repo hygiene,
  and config standardization (`CODEX.md`).
- Jules owns bounded automated maintenance (`JULES.md`).

## Practical Guardrails

- Follow the shared source, validation, and PR rules in `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep assistance scoped to targeted edits, suggestions, and local cleanup.
- Defer release, architecture, and governance decisions to the owning guide.

## Pull Request Creation

Follow the shared PR requirements in `AGENTS.md`.

## Source Of Detailed Guidance

Primary Copilot guidance lives in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
Shared repo boundaries live in `AGENTS.md`.
